Interviewer: Hi, thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. Can you start by telling me why you cook at home?

Interviewee: Sure, I love cooking at home because it's a great way for me to relax and unwind after a long day at work. Plus, it's a lot healthier and more affordable than eating out all the time.

Interviewer: That makes sense. How do you decide what to cook?

Interviewee: Well, I usually plan my meals for the week ahead of time so I don't have to worry about it every day. I like to try new recipes and experiment with different ingredients, but I also stick to some of my family's favorite dishes.

Interviewer: How often do you cook at home?

Interviewee: I cook dinner at home almost every night, but I usually only make breakfast and lunch on the weekends.

Interviewer: What do you like about cooking at home?

Interviewee: I like being in control of what goes into my meals and being able to customize them to my family's preferences. It's also a great way to spend time with my kids in the kitchen.

Interviewer: What frustrates you when you cook at home?

Interviewee: Hmm, probably when I have to use a new appliance that I'm not familiar with. I usually just try to figure it out on my own without reading the manual, which can be frustrating if it doesn't work the way I want it to.

Interviewer: Do you eat breakfast at home? Can you describe your breakfast preparation process?

Interviewee: Yes, I usually make breakfast at home on the weekends. I like to make things like pancakes or waffles, and I always have some eggs and toast.

Interviewer: And how about dinner? Can you describe your dinner preparation process?

Interviewee: Sure, I usually start by marinating meat or chopping vegetables, then I'll either use the oven, stove, or slow cooker depending on the recipe. I try to make things that are quick and easy, but also flavorful and healthy.

Interviewer: Do you consider buying an additional kitchen appliance in the nearest future? Why and which appliance, if yes?

Interviewee: Yes, I've been thinking about getting an air fryer to make healthier versions of fried foods. It seems like a versatile appliance that can be used for a lot of different things.
Interviewer: That's great! What types of cuisines do you enjoy cooking the most?
Interviewee: I love trying out Asian and Middle Eastern recipes, but I also enjoy making classic American dishes and Italian pasta dishes.
Interviewer: That sounds like a lot of fun. What types of domestic appliances do you currently use in your cooking?
Interviewee: Right now, I just have a basic set up with a stove, oven, and a blender. I also have a hand mixer for baking.
Interviewer: Are there any other appliances that you're considering buying to help with your cooking?
Interviewee: Definitely! I've been thinking about getting a rice cooker, a slow cooker, and an immersion blender.
Interviewer: How do you decide which appliances to buy and which recipes to make using those appliances?
Interviewee: I usually buy appliances based on the recipes I want to make. For example, I want to make more Asian recipes that require rice, so I want to get a rice cooker. And for Middle Eastern recipes, a slow cooker would be great for making stews and tagines.
Interviewer: How do you balance convenience with the desire to make homemade, high-quality meals?
Interviewee: It can be a challenge, but I try to strike a balance. I want to make homemade meals that taste great, but I also don't want to spend hours in the kitchen. That's why I think appliances are so important.
Interviewer: That makes sense. How do you plan on maintaining and cleaning your appliances?
Interviewee: I'll make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance. And I'll be careful not to overload or misuse the appliances to ensure they last as long as possible.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your insights with me today. It was great to talk to you.
Interviewee: Thanks for having me! It was fun to talk about cooking.
